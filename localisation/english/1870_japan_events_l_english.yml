These influential figures possess considerable power and have their own visions for Japan's future. The Emperor symbolizes the unity and spiritual authority of the nation, but his authority is underpinned by the very men who helped him ascend to power. The Genrō, the elder statesmen of our new regime, with their experience in both governance and warfare, advocate for rapid modernization and Westernization, believing that this is the only path to secure Japan’s place among the great powers. Attempting to centralize power under the Emperor could lead to internal resistance because of these influential men. Empowering the Genrō could ensure swift modernization, but it may also diminish the Emperor's authority, leading to a future where the throne is overshadowed by the ambitions of politicans. "

 fpw_japan.62.d:0 "After several years of rigorous study and training in Prussia, our officers have returned home, bringing with them a wealth of knowledge about the Prussian military system. They have absorbed the lessons of the Prussian victories and now advocate for the integration of these doctrines into our army. Their proposals include the adoption of Prussian infantry tactics, a more efficient logistics system, and the establishment of a centralized general staff. This marks a crucial step forward in our efforts to modernize the Japanese military and secure our place among the great powers of the world. "
