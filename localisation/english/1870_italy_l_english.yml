I was kicked off britain and then just started doing random stuff like GFX. I did much work on Austria and then I was kicked off the dev team and banned from the server for essentially, argueing too much with the rest of the team over many things, such as the removal of the 1870 start date. This was my project to show them that they were wrong, design the best content I ever have and get back on the team. That is the history of the whole scenario.
